A reversi game written in python. More about the game reversi can be found here: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reversi. 

In this version of reversi a human plays against a computer. A separate file "reversi.py" was provided for the assignment. This file initializes the game board using the quickdraw app and gets the moves from the computer and the human player. The file "game.py" contains methods and attributes that control how the game plays. These methods and attributes contain lists and when the human player chooses a move on the 2D board, lists are used to check if the moves is available, select the move, and update the possible moves available for the AI to make. 

The attached screenshots show the game board and a diagram of the lists/methods used in the game.
